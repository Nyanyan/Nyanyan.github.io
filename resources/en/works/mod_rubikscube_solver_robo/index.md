# Modified Rubik's Cube Solver Robo

Modified "Rubik's Cube Solver Robo" by Toys "R" Us Original (2022)



I tried modifying the Toys "R" Us original "Rubik's Cube Solver Robo" that I helped commercialize.

I installed a color sensor that is not in the commercial version, and wrote my own program to achieve smoother movement.
