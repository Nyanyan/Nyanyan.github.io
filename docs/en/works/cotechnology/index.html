<h1>Cotechnology</h1><p>Parallel Othello AI with STM32 (2023)</p><p>This is a parallel Othello AI with microcontrollers. There are 15 nodes connected, and each node has a STM32F401 board and a matrix LED. This solves the exact score of an Othello board with 21 empties.</p><p>I compared the human society with the parallel computing.</p><p>STM32 Board Provided by STMicroelectronics Mr. Yoshiaki Nakamura</p><h2 id="Work Caption ">Work Caption </h2><p>Technology, for better or worse, is immensely useful. I currently don't know how I should handle such technology myself. In the first place, for me, making things was just a hobby. It still is. However, that hobby, without me realizing it, gradually became something clearly "useful." When this happens, even if it's just a hobby, I gradually start to think about the impact my creations have on others and on myself.</p><p>In society, people divide a single job among multiple individuals. A large task is carried out by many people. One person alone cannot complete a very large job. In fact, this idea is the same for computers. Although computer performance improves year by year, there are limits to that as well. Therefore, by using multiple computers and cleverly dividing the work, processing can be sped up.</p><p>Now, will I successfully acquire the skill of collaborating with technology and live my life that way? Will I be satisfied with that? Or will I approach technology and manufacturing in a different way? Looking at "Cotechnology", I am now reconsidering these questions.</p><div class="youtube"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nRlb4U1kdU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/img1.jpg" width="100%"></div><div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/img2.jpg" width="100%"></div><div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/img3.jpg" width="100%"></div></div>
